Diary format (tag set)

Paragraph (Text block) tags:
P       - Paragraph - takes optionally the name of the author (which
          may be the literal anonymous).
C       - Chapter - takes all arguments of a P, date (Format:
          dd/mm/yy) and title.
S       - Can be used everywhere where a P can be used, but does not
          effects the text in any way, as a paragraph does. Mainly
          usefull for naming and reffering to with an Include.
Quote   - A quote of what someone else wrote. More os less the same
          as a contained P with author set... But a bit more part of
          the containing block, since it is not an own
          paragraph. Takes the author as arg.
F       - Footnote - takes no args.
Comment - Editorial comment. The first item is the comment, on the
          rest of the items. The first item must be a paragraph.
Paus    - Comment on why there was an interruption of the
          writing. Implies P and Comment (on nothing).
Expl    - Explanation of a term/word. Takes no arguments. The first item
          should be a P containing the explanation, of the rest of
          the items.

Group tags:
List    - Unordered list of P:s and/or C:s.
Conversation
        - A conversation between different authors. May only contain
          P-tags, and all of them must have an author specified. As a
          script for a theatre.

Mode (sentense/word) tags:
Do      - Something done by the author, like *foo* in mail/chat.
Tag     - Something that should appear as a XML tag in the output, as
          in <Ironic>I don't hate anything</Ironic>. Takes one
          argument, content, the content of the open tag as a string.
Em      - With emphasis, like _foo_ in mail/chat, italic or bold.
Tm      - Trademarked, as in 'A Good Thing<Tm>'.
Namify  - As in 'and other Evil'.

Special tags:
Code    - Code example - indentation, line breaks, etc. are
          preserved.
Link    - A link to some reference, e.g. a web-page, a book or
          whatever. Takes one arg, ref, which is a URL to the
          resource. Wiered protocols like book:// are allowed. Most of
          these consists of just a bounch of foo=bar-pairs, separated
          by coma. Note that spaces should be encoded as spaces or
          new-line, not %20. Available protocols (To be extended if
          bessesary):
          book://(..*=.*,)*(..*=.*)?
          Parameters: isbn, title, subtitle, author, copy, copyyear
          One special URl is tag://name, whith name exchanged for a
          name of one of the tags named with a name-arg, in the
          document (see include for more info on this).
I       - Include the content of some other tag (args and sub-items),
          named as stated in the single arg r. The result is as if
          the whole include-block had been exchanged for the named
          block. All tags may be named using a name arg.
